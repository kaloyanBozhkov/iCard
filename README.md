<p>This was a five day quick project I worked on when applying for iCard. They gave me a PSD file on which I based all the styling of the webpage. The project was a successful pass, although there were many things that could be done better looking at it now. Prioritizing CSS keyframes for animations, instead of relying entirely on JQuery's animate method, is one of the different earlier approaches of mine that I now cannot help but cringe when looking at now.<br/>This project is an example of my earlier responsive design abilities, and my first project for a company which ended up wanting to hire me.</p>
